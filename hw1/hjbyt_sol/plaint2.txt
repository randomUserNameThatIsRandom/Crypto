poverty and the breakdown of family life have secondary
effects children wander about the streets of the townships
because they have no schools to go to or no money to
enable them to go to school or no parents at home to see
that they go to school because both parents if there be
two have to work to keep the family alive this leads to
a breakdown in moral standards to an alarming rise in
illegitimacy and to growing violence which erupts not
only politically but everywhere life in the townships
is dangerous there is not a day that goes by without
somebody being stabbed or assaulted and violence is
carried out of the townships into the white living areas
people are afraid to walk alone in the streets after dark
housebreakings and robberies are increasing despite the
fact that the death sentence can now be imposed for
such offences death sentences cannot cure the festering sore

during my lifetime i have dedicated my life to this struggle
of the african people i have fought against white domination
and i have fought against black domination i have cherished the
ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will
live together in harmony and with equal opportunities it is an
ideal for which i hope to live for and to see realised but my
lord if it needs be it is an ideal for which i am prepared to
die
